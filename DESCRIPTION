Description: Allows you to make clean, good-looking scatter plots with the 
    option to easily add marginal density or box plots on the axes. It is also 
    available as a module for 'jamovi' (see <https://www.jamovi.org> for more 
    information). 'Scatr' is based on the 'cowplot' package by Claus O. Wilke 
    and the 'ggplot2' package by Hadley Wickham.
